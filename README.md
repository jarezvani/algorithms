https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_expression

This algorithm takes advantage of Binet's formula, which allows the nth Fibonacci number to be calculated in constant time using the least possible amount of memory. The accepted time complexity of the traditional recursive formula is ~Î¸(1.6n).
